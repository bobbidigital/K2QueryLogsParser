Purpose:

THIS IS NOT A FULL FRAMEWORK. I originally wrote this for a task at work. It's very specific to that task so you may
find certain functionality missing. The code should be easy enough to understand though, so that if you need to modify
or add to it, you should be able to.

The code assumes a database exists. I've only written a store for Microsoft SQL Server. The mssql_database_create.sql
script will create the necessary database tables for you. The schema is fairly basic.

Requirements:

This leverages lxml as well as the pymssql library for database connectivity
